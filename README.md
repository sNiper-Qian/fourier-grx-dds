# fourier-grx-dds

This is the library for controlling the Fourier GRX robot using DDS communication protocol.

## ‚ùó Breaking Changes

For users who have been using fourier-grx-client and those who are new to this library, Please note the following features:

- fourier-grx-dds implements the low-level communication protocol using C++, achieving lower resource occupation and faster control frequency.
- Most of the methods in fourier-grx-dds follow the same protocol as in Fourier-GRX-Client, making it easy for Fourier-GRX-Client users to switch over.
